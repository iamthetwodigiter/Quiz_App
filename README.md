## Code Walkthrough

### Key Widgets and Components

#### **QuestionPage**
- Handles the display and navigation of quiz questions.
- Features real-time answer validation and summary dialogs.
- Utilizes `QuestionCard` for rendering individual questions.

#### **QuestionCard**
- A reusable widget for rendering a single question and its options.
- Highlights selected and correct answers.

#### **Dialogs**
- Custom dialogs for showing hints, solutions, and quiz summaries.
- Implements gamified coin deduction mechanics.

### State Management

State is managed via Riverpod providers:
- `quizProvider`: Caches quiz data using `AsyncValue` for error handling and loading states.
- `userDataProvider`: Tracks user progress, including marks, attempts, and coins.

### Persistent Data Handling

Using Hive for local storage:
- `UserDataNotifier`: Saves and retrieves user-specific data (marks, coins, progress).
- `saveQuestionProgress`: Stores details of attempted questions persistently.

#### Example:
```dart
void saveQuestionProgress({
  required String testId,
  required int questionId,
  required String selectedOption,
  required bool isCorrect,
}) {
  Map<dynamic, dynamic> testDetails = _quizBox.get(testId, defaultValue: {});
  testDetails[questionId.toString()] = {
    'selectedOption': selectedOption,
    'isCorrect': isCorrect,
  };
  _quizBox.put(testId, testDetails);
}
```

## Gamification Features

1. **Coins**:
   - Earn 2 coins for every correct answer.
   - Deduct 5 coins to view a hint or solution.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - Correct answers add to the userâ€™s score.
   - Negative marks for incorrect answers.

3. **Summary Dialog**:
   - Displays attempted, skipped, and correct questions.
   - Shows current coins and total marks.
